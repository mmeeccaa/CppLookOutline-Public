# CppLookOutline  
- [日本語版はこちら](README.jp.md)  
  
This extends the Visual Studio C/C++ outline to make it more readable.  

## How to use  
1. Please install the vsix file.
2. To use it, please disable the default outline functionality.  
[Options] > [Text Editor] > [C/C++] > [Display] > [Enable outline display] > True  

## Features
This tool has the following features:  
- Make the first line visible when folding a multi-line comment.  
- Supports the summary tag of XML comments.  
- Fold arguments for functions with multi-line arguments.  

Normally, when folding multi-line comments in VC++, it is abbreviated as ...,  
This requires frequent expansion to check the contents, which is time-consuming.  
This extension adds an outline function similar to the C# editor as shown below, and has the ability to visualize simple contents.
